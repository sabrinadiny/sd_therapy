- add Events / Epochs to Preproc. Therefore we need:
    [x] ak.do_events() - 'STI101' the right channel?
    [x] create event_dict (Triggervalues)
    [x] length of each condition
    [ ] adjust for sound-delay (air-tubes MEG)?
    [x] ak.do_epochs()

- Preproc Cluster Script:
    [x] how many blocks?
    [ ] maye do all blocks in one Job? (how to handle exceptions?)
    [x] add helper function to get all subjects
    [ ] check storing conditions of preproc data
    [ ] freesurfer - subjects for source

- Preproc Audio
    [ ] extract audio envelopes
    [ ] add envelopes to mne - data?

- Sync Data from Sinuhe to SCC:
    [x] set up plus_sync (bomber and SCC-User are needed)

- Analysis Scripts
    [ ] what channels do we need (e.g. ECG, MEG, ...)?
    [ ] what do we want to compute for these channels (e.g. RMS, ...)?
